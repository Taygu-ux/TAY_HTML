    <h1>The universe, stars, and constellations are inspirations to my design.</h1>
    <p>Taegu Kang is deeply fascinated by applied design that draws inspiration from the universe, stars, and constellations. This interest extends beyond mere aesthetics, incorporating celestial themes into functional and meaningful design solutions. By exploring the vastness of space, Taegu finds inspiration in the elegance of planetary orbits, the intricate geometry of constellations, and the dynamic movement of celestial bodies.</p>
    <div style="background-color: rgb(100, 130, 210); padding: 300px;">
        <p style="font-size: 40px;"> Designs created by inspirations.</p>

    <p>From the moment I first gazed up at a clear night sky, I felt an unshakable connection to the celestial patterns that have guided, inspired, and mystified humanity for millennia. Constellations, more than just clusters of stars, are stories woven into the vastness of space—symbols of ancient mythology, cultural identity, and scientific discovery. My passion for constellations extends beyond their visual beauty; it is rooted in their ability to bridge science, history, and design, offering endless inspiration for creative exploration.</p>

    <p>Beyond design, my fascination with constellations is deeply personal. Looking at the stars has always been a source of reflection and perspective. The vastness of the universe reminds me of the endless possibilities in creativity and exploration, while the constellations themselves serve as a reminder of human ingenuity and storytelling. Whether standing beneath the star-filled skies of a remote location or using planetarium software to study celestial alignments, I feel a profound sense of connection to something much greater than myself.
    
        Ultimately, my interest in constellations is not just about their beauty or history—it is about their ability to inspire awe, curiosity, and innovation. As I continue to explore their influence in my work, I hope to create designs that capture the essence of the cosmos, merging ancient wisdom with futuristic possibilities. Constellations, to me, are more than just stars; they are a blueprint for creativity, a map to understanding the world and our place within it.</p>
